I know I can study hard if I want to. but I end up staying at home instead of studying and getting involved at university. It could be because of emotional neglect? Helicopter parenting? Not having belief in myself? Any advice welcome. im mainly looking for people to bounce opinions. My strategy is eating 2 meals a day, 1200 calories total.

Fresh and hot. The gal who brought them in urged me to take one, I said --after This may be a little long and I appreciate anyone who reads. I’ll try to summarize. The difficult time began on my birthday at the end of summer. I had just helped move my boyfriend across the country to his new school. I spent my birthday with him and he asked me to marry him once we were both done with school (him with his bachelors, and me in law school). We had been together for six and a half years. We had known each other for thirteen years. We had gone through a lot together I 18 F move to another country with my mom, and my boyfriend 18 M will be joining us in 1year and a half. We have been together for almost 4 years. and we are engaged. But. We are staying in my mom's friend's house, and her son, who is 3 years older than me, lives there too. I've realized that we have a lot of things in common, and he is very charming and kind. and I think a part of me likes him. and we've become close friends and he told me his intentions, but that he understands. Hi everyone! Just looking for advice. I have a hard time focusing, and feel like I'm kind of drifting through life. I daydream a LOT, like I could just spend entire days outside listening to music, or watching some of my favorite movies, talking to some of my really good friends, or looking at art. Eventually, I'll get bored of just chilling out and then decide to do work and study, but it probably takes around two weeks for me to feel READY to get into that head space. And even then, after. Due to abusive family, I've never had real-life friends, and the last time that I've talked to a friend was almost 3 years ago. The last time that I've talked to a real-life acquaintance was almost 5 years ago. I rarely leave the house, and I have spent up to 2 years inside. I feel like my life is hopeless, because for improvement I would either have to go to school (for many years), find a terrible job, and do other things. I typically find no joy in everyday life. I'm a 19-year-old male.
